# Reel Feels
Content sharing platform that provides insights into user emotions and emotional changes

# The "What" of it
The idea is to have a platform where content creators, similar to those on YouTube or Twitch, can either upload or share their content for users to view. Apart from the usual metrics such as user views and likes/dislikes, the content creators will be able to see (either in graph form or via some other visual representation) how the users felt while viewing content. This is extremely valuable information for content creators as it allows them to determine weaknesses in their content and equips them with the data necessary to produce better content.

The application will require a device with a front facing camera, such as a laptop or a phone, in order to read the userâ€™s facial features using the Affectiva API to determine their emotions. The Affectiva API runs purely on the browser and does not require any additional resources.
